# README

Welcome to the Library Management application. Also, Thank you for taking the time out to read this.

Test Cases:

##Entry Point

* You will not be able to sign up as an admin.
* However, we have a root user with the following credentials:
Email: admin@admin.com
Password: password
PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THIS. WE BEG YOU!! :D
* Sign up as a library member and go to manage users from the root login.
You can upgrade your membership to have admin access.

##View Room Schedule:

Both Admins and Library Members can view reservation schedule for the day. There's a tab to view that!

##View Booking History:

Again, you have a tab!

##Special Cases:(Maintaining Data-integrity at deletion)
* Deleting a user with an active booking, deletes that booking as well as booking history of the user
* Deleting a room with bookings, releases those bookings as well as booking history for that room.

##Thank you!!
